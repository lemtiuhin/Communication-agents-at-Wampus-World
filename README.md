Communication agents at Wampus-World

This project is made for laboratory work 3-4. "Communication agents in the Wampus world"

Purpose: familiarization with the methods of analysis of natural language expressions for the implementation of communication models in multi-agent systems.

1. Based on the skeletal code of the multi-agent system built in L/R No. 1 and 2, implement a system of two agents: an agent-speler and an agent-navigator, in the world    of Wampus.
2. The caving agent should not have its own decision-making algorithm, but should transmit the information it receives about the environment to the agent-navigator           through the communication channel in English (truncated version to Wampus-English).
3. The navigator agent, receiving information from the speleologist agent, must process the incoming message, if necessary, request additional information and, finding a    decision about the current action being performed, send this decision in the form of a natural language message to the speleologist agent.
